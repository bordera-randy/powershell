## Randy Bordeaux

I’m an **IT engineer and cloud practitioner** with a focus on **PowerShell automation**, **Azure**, and **Microsoft 365** administration. I work day-to-day in environments where reliability, repeatability, and clarity matter—often under compliance, security, or operational pressure.

This repository exists because too much real-world IT work still relies on:

* one-off scripts sitting on someone’s desktop
* tribal knowledge passed verbally
* half-finished examples copied from blog posts
* automation that works *once* but not safely or repeatably

That approach doesn’t scale—and it fails the next person who has to maintain it.

## Why This Repository Exists

**PowerShell-Utility** is a growing collection of **practical, reusable PowerShell scripts** designed to help IT professionals:

* Manage **Azure** and **Microsoft 365**
* Automate common administrative tasks
* Troubleshoot issues faster
* Reduce manual effort and human error
* Learn *why* a script works, not just copy/paste it

Every script here is written with the assumption that:

* You’re managing real systems
* Mistakes have real consequences
* Clarity is more important than cleverness

---

## Design Principles

Scripts in this repository aim to follow a few core rules:

* **Readable over clever**
  If a script can’t be understood six months later, it’s a liability.

* **Safe by default**
  No destructive actions without clear intent and warnings.

* **Practical, not theoretical**
  These are scripts I use, refine, or wish existed when solving real problems.

* **Well-documented**
  Inline comments and usage notes matter as much as the code itself.

## Who This Is For

This repo is for:

* IT administrators
* Cloud and DevOps engineers
* Azure and Microsoft 365 practitioners
* Anyone learning PowerShell through real examples

It’s especially useful if you’re tired of shallow examples and want scripts that reflect how systems are actually run.

---

## How You Can Use It

* Clone the repo and adapt scripts to your environment
* Use it as a reference when building your own automation
* Learn PowerShell patterns that scale beyond one-off tasks

If something here helps you, use it.
If something can be improved, improve it.

## Contributions & Feedback

This is a public repository because shared tools make everyone better.

* Issues and suggestions are welcome
* Pull requests are welcome
* Constructive feedback is encouraged

The goal isn’t perfection—it’s **useful, honest automation**.

---

*Automate the boring parts. Document the hard parts. Leave things better than you found them.*
